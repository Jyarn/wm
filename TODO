ISSUES:
[ ] easyeffects window not appearing
notes: not running, or slowing down execution seems to make it appear => event handler issue
       setup configure request (broken again)
[x] alacritty crashing the window manager
notes: no clue what happened but it got fixed. now whenever it crashes it doesn't give me any debug info :D
[x] typing into (completley?) overlapped windows
note: looks like it only breaks if easyeffects isn't running
segfault wm.c:158
[x] memory leak at wm.c:204
notes: not closing log file
[x] Enabling XSelectInput for newly managed windows causes a BadAccess error when opening alacritty
notes: it looks like the error is coming from XNextEvent instead of XSelectInput which is weird (need to verify on desktop)
On laptop, wm doesn't even start I assume this is the same issue
On laptop, changing the mask in wm_manage to the one used in dwm seems to fix the issue
[x] Closing alacritty causes a BadWindow
[x] dragging stops X from sending events to client D:
notes:
jesus christ finally fixed it
[x] only able to move a window once, after which motion handler doesn't seem to receive events
notes:
cleanup is not always run before if a motion func does not reset
[x] movewindow warps the top left corner of the window to the mouse
notes:
it looks funny
[x] button presses do not register for certain windows
notes: changed grabmode in grabMouse to Sync
[ ] unable to select text
