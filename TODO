ISSUES:
 [ ] easyeffects window not appearing
      notes: not running, or slowing down execution seems to make it appear => event handler issue
 [x] alacritty crashing the window manager
      notes: no clue what happened but it got fixed. now whenever it crashes it doesn't give me any debug info :D
 [x] typing into (completley?) overlapped windows
      note: looks like it only breaks if easyeffects isn't running
            segfault wm.c:158
 [x] memory leak at wm.c:204
      notes: not closing log file
 [x] Enabling XSelectInput for newly managed windows causes a BadAccess error when opening alacritty
      notes: it looks like the error is coming from XNextEvent instead of XSelectInput which is weird (need to verify on desktop)
             On laptop, wm doesn't even start I assume this is the same issue
             On laptop, changing the mask in wm_manage to the one used in dwm seems to fix the issue
 [x] Closing alacritty causes a BadWindow
 [x] dragging stops X from sending events to client D:
      notes:
          jesus christ finally fixed it
 [x] only able to move a window once, after which motion handler doesn't seem to receive events
      notes:
          cleanup is not always run before if a motion func does not reset
 [ ] movewindow warps the top left corner of the window to the mouse
      notes:
          it looks funny
