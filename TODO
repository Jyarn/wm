ISSUES
 [ ] easyeffects window not appearing
      notes: not running, or slowing down execution seems to make it appear => event handler issue
 [x] alacritty crashing the window manager
      notes: no clue what happened but it got fixed. now whenever it crashes it doesn't give me any debug info :D
 [x] typing into (completley?) overlapped windows
      note: looks like it only breaks if easyeffects isn't running
            segfault wm.c:158
 [x] memory leak at wm.c:204
      notes: not closing log file
 [_] Enabling XSelectInput for newly managed windows causes a BadAccess error when opening alacritty
      notes: it looks like the error is coming from XNextEvent instead of XSelectInput which is weird (need to verify on desktop)
             On laptop, wm doesn't even start I assume this is the same issue
             On laptop, changing the mask in wm_manage to the one used in dwm seems to fix the issue
 [x] Closing alacritty causes a BadWindow
